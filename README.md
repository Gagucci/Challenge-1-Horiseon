# Horiseon Social Solutions

## Description

The goal of this project was to take the base code from the Horiseon website and streamline it to make it more accessable for users and more optimized for search engines. This was done through the implementation off alt-text for images, the assigning of classes and ids to more efficiently catagorize and style those elements, altering semantic tags so that elements are in a more acceptable container, and finally formatting the header and ensuring all links in the Nav bar work.
